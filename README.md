Course Introduction
About this course:

PHP was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 as a simple set of Common Gateway Interface script (CGI) in C programming language. Ever since it was released, it has gained huge popularity and roughly about 80% of websites over the entire Internet are now powered by PHP. There has been many changes in PHP, and PHP 5 (the most recent version) is far more capable than its initial version, one of the most notable features is its support of object model and namespace, which provides the platform for developers to write object oriented PHP code. PHP is transitioning into a more modularized architecture, it allows developers to build and customize language per their needs. Meanwhile, PHP tooling has also been improved significantly over the years, many open source and commercial tools are developed to streamline development processes such as continuous integration, static code analysis, build and deployment, and dependencies management.

This course covers many different areas and aims to help students establish a solid foundation to implement Enterprise solution in PHP. Below are several of core focuses:

 * Think, design and implement solution in the OO (object oriented) way.
 * Test driven development. Integrate CI (Continuous integration) service into projects to enable unit testing. Unit testing and CI are essential for writing beautiful and testable code.
 * Design Patterns & modularized design. Learn various design patterns. Design and implement a solution as a standalone module, which can be easily plugged into different code bases.
 * Scability & Performance. Learn the difficult (yet important) task of fulfilling business requirements and implementing new features by writing high performance and scalable code. We will introduce techniques and tools to help profile, identify bottlenecks and come up with a plan of attack to address issues.
 * Manage, deploy code with Git. Manage/share/deploy code with Git and GitHub.com as the primary version control system (VCS) and platform. Become familiar with how they are used in modern open source software development life cycle.

About the Online Environment

Your online course Moodle site offers several advantages and improvements to the traditional classroom, including the comprehensive Online Student Handbook, the ability to communicate electronically with students and with your instructor, and links to a wide array of UW Library Services. We will also utility GitHub issue and wiki system to simulate a real-world software development environment.

Online Student Handbook

Student Handbook answers questions about your online learning course, such as how to purchase your text, obtain a transcript, and get technical help if you need it. The handbook also provides additional resources, such as how to order books or journals from the library and how to study for an online course.

Online Communication

 *    Online Discussion Forums allow you to communicate with other currently enrolled students and with your instructor.
 You can use the General Discussion Forum to post questions, share resources, or engage in conversations about topical
 issues. You may also be asked to participate in lesson- or assignment-related forums.  Posting questions in the forum is the best way to get quick feedback on project/assignment questions. Students will be expected to visit the forum and post answers to other student's questions. The instructor and lab assistant will wait 24 hours before answering questions to allow students to discuss the posts. Instructor and lab assistant will monitor the discussions and respond within 24-72 hours.
 *    E-mail is the best way to communicate with your instructor or lab assistant about feedback you've received on an assignment. The instructor or lab assistant will respond within 24-72 hours. If they do not respond within that time frame, re-send your message with "Second attempt" on the first line.
About the Forums

Regularly participating in the discussion forum is a vital component of this course. In a traditional on-site class, students have the opportunity to interact directly with each other, sharing ideas, opinions and information relating to the course materials. This online forum serves a similar purpose for remote students and for the week between class sessions when everyone is "remote." It is a way for you to "connect" indirectly with other students, while, at the same time, expressing your thoughts about course-related issues that do not necessarily have "right" or "wrong" answers. Writing often helps to clarify one’s thinking, too; at least, it does for me. So, that’s another goal of the discussion forum.   In this class, forums are useful for all students to post questions and get help from other students and the instructor between class sessions. 

About the Online Meetings 

Students attending class remotely will use an online Adobe Connect Meeting Room. Meetings will be recorded and available for review within 24 hours for both classroom and remote students. For the optimal online meeting experience, students should purchase a headset, which will allow them to participate using VoIP technology.  Students should test their headset, PRIOR to their first session, using this Test Room: http://uweoconnect.extn.washington.edu/publictest/ 

NOTE: This is a Test Room only. Your Course meeting room is listed on the main page of your course site. Students who do not have a headset will still be able to participate via a 'chat' feature in the Meeting Room. These students will hear via their computer speakers and can respond/ask questions by typing in a chat field.

Classroom students may attend two sessions online during the course with instructor permission. Remote/online students may attend class in the classroom as often as desired.
